# HexMapGenerator
 
This project creates a 2D hex map and generates new parts of the board while activating and deactivating game objects. In this game generator, I used object pooling and colours from the theory of colours.

You can move the map while moving and holding the right click of your mouse. Moreover, you can mark green or yellow hex when you left-click it.
